          <h2>About</h2>
          <p><i><b>"Do Charity, and Count Your Blessings"</b></i><br><b>Charity-Box</b> is social networking site with the <b>cause</b>. This is little effort to reduce the gap between poor and rich people. By providing financial/social help on right time (when there is need) and from right people (connected, affordable people) to right people (authenticated individual using social networking strength). <b>Charity-Box</b> uses strength of soical networking to authenticate the person in need. Though, the current era is known as era of <b><i>Globalization</i></b>, meaning process of <i><b>International Integration</b></i>. We can question to ourself, Is it truely an era of <b><i>Globalization?</i></b>. This globalization is only confine to very limited class and area. <i>A new OECD report shows the global economic and financial crisis has aggravated social inequality,(<a  href =http://www.dw.de/oecd-warns-of-widening-income-gap-between-rich-and-poor/a-16818836>more</a>)</i>. <b>Charity-Box</b> is an effort to acheive true <b><i>Globalization</i></b>, by integrating the demands from those, who are in true need by supply from those, who can really help/fullfill those needs. <b>Charity-Box</b> is an effort to make our Earth, a better place to live. Better place, where each and every individual can join hands to grow together. This is possible, when each of us make little effort to give <b><i>Smile</i></b>, on every face. <b>Charity-Box</b> is an interface to bridge the gap. This is not possible with only one individual, it requires every one to be part of this. Please, click on <a href=#learnmore>"User's Profile Examples" to know more.</a>, and for understading the transaction flow <a href=#flow>click here</a>, for your contribution please tweet it <a href=#tweet>here</a><br><br>
The simple explanation of charitybox functionality is as follows, the needy user (poors or victims of riots/attacks/natural calamities (earthquake/flood/tsunami)) or their friends or relatives will post need request through <b>Charity-Box</b>. The request will be broadcasted to all, with posting user's relation. The <b>Charity-Box</b> through social networking, provides help by reaching to right person. In return of charity, the donors will recieves <b>Charity-Points</b>, equal to donation/charity made by an individual. The <b>Charity-Points</b> identifies value of an individual in <b>Charity-Box</b>. <b>Charity-Points </b>are measure of an individuals' donation. With every charity (intellectual/material/green), the reciever will give charity points to donar. More charity makes an individual more important. This way the people in need whether an individual himself or individual's friend/relative, get authentication for "need" inherently by using social-networking strength. The <b>Charity-Points</b> are transferrable from one individual to other individual in network.<br>
This can be considered as bridge to decrease the gap of poor (demand) and rich (supply). How is it different from other social networking sites and NGOs, is explained with example in <a href=#FAQ>FAQ.</a><br>

Green Charity-Box is an effort to keep the earth green, by using strength of social networking.
"Going green" doesn't have to be a daunting task that means sweeping life changes. Simple things can make a difference.
The Green Charity using social networking site can be done in following ways;
<ul>
    <li> Car Pool: Connect with other known and authenticated commuters, while travelling (going to work/shopping/malls/exhibitions). <b>Green Charity Box</b>, provides the known and authenticated commuter in your social network, who are commuting in same direction. The authentication is done via <i>I Know</i>, clicks of posted request.
    <li> Buying Second Hand Item: Consider buying second-hand items. Toys, bicycles, roller blades, and other age and size-specific items are quickly outgrown.

                    Charity-Box is social networking site with the <b>cause</b>. Its an effort to reduce the increasing gap between rich and poor people. It achieves this by providing the help at right time (using networking) to right people (authenticated needy people social network) from right people (an affordable known people). This way the people in need whether an individual himself or individual's friend/relative, get authentication of "legal" inherently by using social-networking strength. Here, we will refer request for charity as demand and response to that request as supply. As shown in Figure, e.g., An individual's friend's father met an accident details attached, needs kidney for his surgery. He will raise request, call it as <b>demand</b>, as shown in figure. The response is mentioned as <b>supply</b>. If we search/raise request on<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Google search</b> engine, it will display all the results, shown in bigger circle, with blue dots, which are either links of organ banks, or organ donar. The google search results are not satisfactory because, it doesn't give relevant results. It lacks authentication of an individual. It shows results of individual who have posted on the web or have independent website.<br>
    <li><b>Facebook/Google+</b>, as shown in figure, it shows response of an individual friend's circle/group. This may or may not provide the solution to raised request.The results' reach-ability is as close as asking individual's friend. It provides authentication, but search space is very small. Thus, response space is very limited.<br>
    <li><b>Twitter</b>, as shown in figure, when the request is tweeted, that will be visible to an individual's follower. These followers may or may not be individual's friend. This is shown in figure, using overlapping circles between, twitter and facebook. The result lacks the authentication and has very limited search space. The space is confine to only followers.<br>
    <li>In <b>Charity-box</b>, It starts from an individual's friend circle, and using social networking strength it can grow to an anonymous individual. The anonymous individual may not be known person, but it can provide response to the raised request. Here, the search space is not limited, it is growing unless response is provided. It provides inherent authentication from an individual.<br>
</ul>
The <b>Charity-Box</b> is dynamically growing social networking site, till the response of raised request is met. It is elastic social-network. An individual network grows temporary, till it gets response of raised request. It comes back to same size once request is responded, thus individual network is elastic in nature. The growing network is shown in figure with "dotted" circles.<br>
The comparison is as shown in figure,the dots represents search results. When requested queries are serached using different social networks are shown. <b>Google search</b> results are bigger but the result is irrelavant and doesn't serve the request. <b>Facebook</b> <b>Twitter</b> and <b>Google+</b> search space is very limited, confine to either friends or followers, but the results are authenticated, due to social networking strength. Whereas, "dotted red-color", <b>Charity-Box</b>, search space is elastic and authenticated. This grows temporarily till raised request is responded.

                    Its like any other social network site, every new individual opens account, with its mail id, user name and password. Once the account is created, the profile is created using:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Personal Information: Email Id, contact/mobile number.
                        <li> Professional Information: Current profession, past profession, education and all the information from linkedin.
                        <li> Security Settings: Password, authentication question.
                        <li> Friend List: Populate friend list from, gmail id, facebook contacts, linkedin contacts.
                    </ul>
                    Each user creates profile and that profile will be used for social networking. An individual, post request, and request is responded in dynamically growing network by another individual, as shown in above figure. The individual can post request and respond to posted request. Each raised request consists of:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Request Statement: One line or few lines request statement. It can be demand based request, in which each individual raise request if there is demand/need of charity.e.g. 
                            <ul>
                                <li><il>"Mr. XYZ met with an accident need immediate blood (O -ve) and $10,000 for brain surgery."</il>
                                <li><il>"Needs volunteer for blind school primary class teaching for 5 hrs/month"</il>
                                <li><il>"I need guidance for taking admission in university ABC for XYZ course"</il>
                                <li><il>"Tsunami Relied Funds, donate old cloths, moey etc."</il>
                            </ul>
                            It can be supply request: In which an individual have enough resources (money/time/energy) to donate. An individual wants to know the proper (authenticated) channel/medium and needy person to get benefit from that donation. Example of request can be:
                            <ul>
                                <li><il> "I want to donate old books, toys and school accessories (pencil/pen/notebook)"</il>
                                <li><il> "I want to donate $10/month for cancer treatment or cardiac treatment"</il>
                            </ul>
                        <li> Supporting Attachment: Each raised request (demand request) will have supporting documents. Example, Doctors' prescription, hospital's admission form, any authenticating/supporting documents. 
                        <li> User options: Each raised request will have user's option e.g. demand request have , <i>"I Know"</i>, <i>"I Know and I donated"</i>, <i>"Share"</i>, whenever an individual come across the raised request, it will pass that request to his/her contacts, with following options. Each of these options are counters, if an individual knows raised request, he/she will click on <i>"I Know"</i> option, each click increases counter. This way it will get inherently authenticated by individuals, who views the raised request. Increased counter indicates more authenticated request. It keeps increasing untill counter <i>"I Know and I donated"</i>, can make the requested amount <i>"0"</i>. If an individual doesn't know ab't "request statement", it will simply click on "share" counter, for helping to find donar. Once the reciever gets donation the auto-acknowledgement is sent to <b>charity-box</b>. The <b>charity-box</b> calculates equivalent <b>charity-points</b> corresponding to received auto-ack. Those <b>charity-points</b> will be sent to donar accounts.
